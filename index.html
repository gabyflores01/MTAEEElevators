     <div class="story">

        <p>70 train stations are getting a lift. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority is adding elevators across the five boroughs, investing nearly $6 billion dollars to the endeavor and modernization of 78 existing elevators. </p>
        
        <p> Currently, the MTA subway station has 163 elevators, according to a United States government data catalog. All elevators must comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, which intends to make public spaces more accessible for people with disabilities. When deciding where to install elevators, the MTA considers a station’s ridership, the demographics of its surrounding neighborhood, train transfers, and the location of nearby stations that are already elevator-equipped. By 2055, the system aims to make 95% of its subway stations accessible, according to the MTA’s website. </p>
        
        <p> Despite Brooklyn having the most MTA stations, with a total of 169 subways, it has the second lowest rate of accessible elevators at 26.6%. Across the borough there are 45 elevators with another 10 stations in progress. Those stations under construction, however, do not include Franklin Av - Medgar Evers College/Botanic Garden, Winthrop St, and Parkside Av; three locations that advocates from Brooklyn’s Community Board 9 were hoping to make ADA accessible. </p>

        <p> “TKTKTKTKTK,” said a Community Board 9 member. </p>

        <p> The Bronx has the lowest share of elevators across its 70 stations, with only 25.7% being ADA accessible - an additional five stations are coming uptown.  </p>

        
        <p> Manhattan houses the most elevators in the MTA system with 69 elevators located throughout 153 stations; eight more stations will be ADA accessible in the borough. Followed by Queens with 25 stations out of 83 elevators equipped and another nine under way. Recently, two elevators at Queensboro Plaza opened on Dec. 12. Staten Island, with the least number of train station across the city, has six out of its 21 stations. </p> 

        <p> Elevators that are being installed are officially opening on a rolling basis.  </p>
